# Steps - Mars exploration registration form

## Pre-requisite

I have not uploaded the node_modules folder here, so we will need to install all required packages

```bash
npm install
```

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.
